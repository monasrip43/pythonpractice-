# balance = 1000
# thread -1 ---withdraw 500
# thread -2 ---withdraw 700

# both are accessing the same variable
# without proper control


# Incorrect balance
# wrong transaction
# data corrupts
# to avoid the above we will use:
# Synchronization :
# this is a process of controlling access to shared
# resources so that only one thread modifies at a time 

# Lock :
# hared 
# resources : any variable,file,database,object

# Example :
# count = 0
# if multiple threads modifies count simultaneously
 
# #Race Condition :
# occurs when multiple threads access and modify
# shared data simultaneously causing unpredictable
# outputs :

# critical section:
# code section where shared resources are accessed is called critical section

# count+=1 ---> critical section

# to avoid the critical section:
# with the help of lock we can avoid the critical section

# one thread should enter the critical section at a time
# solution:
# Lock

# what is a lock?
# synchronisation mechanism that allows 
# only one thread to execute a critical section at a time.

# Thread A acquires Lock
# other threads will wait
# Thread A releases lock
# next thread gets lock

# import threading
# lock= threading.Lock()

# lock.acquire() ---> to apply the lock
# lock.release() ---> to release the lock
